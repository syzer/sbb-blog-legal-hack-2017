# Idea

# admin.ch
Article is in states: in kraft vs in force


## search for SRG (unique number)
each document has unique id (SR-XXX)
ex: try searching for DSG:
[https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19920153/index.html]()


## general law
[https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19920153/index.html]()
no changes in dsg resent changes

## chronology
[https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19920153/history.html]()

## actual changes to that law and other law related
[https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19920153/changes.html]()



# challenges(things to solve):
- figure out new changes on the page (updates to a law)
- changes to that particular law vs changes to other laws conceding that particular law
    - ex: "GeÃ¤ndert in anderem Erlass"
    - ex: "Berichtigung"  => https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/official-compilation/2016/2307.pdf
    
- diffining/comparision between 2 revision
    - [ ] find examples:
    - [ ] sometimes they post just difs ...
    - [ ] sometimes they post new revision ...
    - [ ] sometimes the post just a diff (which is the most interesting)
    
- knowing what the change is (that is the meaning or scope)
- check relevancy
- define relevant "Buzz Words" / relevant fields/topics for the matching Notifications
- push relevant information
- figure out what needs to be changed in businees process to comply with taht change
- how can the user add or delete new sources
- how can the user define words/profile for notifications


# TODO (for further revision)
